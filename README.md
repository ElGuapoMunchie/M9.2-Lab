# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This program simulates a game kind of like slither.io. You play as an "Evil Circle"
who is hungry and wants to rule the world! But to do so, you need to go around and 
eat all your competitors. To play, use the "wasd" characters to move around the map
and watch as your score grows! Watch out though, as the clock goes on, the number of
balls will increase too!

## Compiling and Running the program:

First, clone this repo to a new local directory on your system. Then, you can open
and run the code in `VSCode` using the `LivePreview` extension (you'll need to download
it if you don't already have it installed).

Or you can run the code by entering `./index.html` into your terminal application once
you've opened the directory containing all the files. Using this method will open the program
in your browser automatically.

To close the game, simply exit out by clicking the red 'x' in the top right corner.
